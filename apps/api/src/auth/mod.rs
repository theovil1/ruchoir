//! Authentication: password hashing, opaque sessions, the session cookie and the HTTP routes.
//!
//! The API owns auth end to end. Passwords are argon2id; sessions are opaque records in Valkey
//! delivered as a hardened `__Host-` cookie; the client never holds an auth secret. The
//! authorization guard (extracting the caller from the session on every protected request) and
//! MFA build on these pieces in later steps.
