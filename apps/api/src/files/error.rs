//! Error type for the files surface, and its HTTP representation.
//!
//! Like the messaging errors, responses are terse and uniform and never leak internals. Authorization
//! failures collapse to a flat `403` that does not distinguish "does not exist" from "not allowed to
//! see it", so the API never confirms a file's existence to someone who cannot access it. `NotFound`
//! is used only once the caller is already allowed to address the resource (for example a file whose
//! bytes were never uploaded, or a soft-deleted file a space member asked for by id).
