//! Error type for the messaging and real-time surface, and its HTTP representation.
//!
//! Like the auth errors, responses are terse and uniform: a small JSON `{error, message}` body,
//! never leaking internals, database detail or private message content. Authorization failures are
//! deliberately a flat `403 forbidden` that does not distinguish "does not exist" from "not allowed
//! to see it", so the API never confirms the existence of a resource to someone who cannot access
//! it. Use [`ApiError::NotFound`] only for resources the caller is already allowed to address.
