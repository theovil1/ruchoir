//! The messaging domain: the REST surface over the collaboration schema.
//!
//! Every mutation here is a typed, authorized HTTP handler; after it commits it hands the resulting
//! event to [`crate::realtime`] for fan-out. Reads and writes share one authorization choke point
//! ([`authz`]) and one DTO builder ([`messages::hydrate_messages`]).
//!
//! - [`authz`] - conversation membership guards and audience computation.
//! - [`dto`] - request and response shapes (close to the web data seam).
//! - [`error`] - the `ApiError` type and its HTTP mapping.
//! - [`mentions`] - `@`-mention parsing and resolution.
//! - [`messages`] / [`reactions`] / [`read`] / [`pins`] / [`saved`] / [`conversations`] - handlers.
//! - [`routes`] - the sub-router.
