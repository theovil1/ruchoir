//! The real-time hub: local connection registry plus the Valkey pub/sub bridge.
//!
//! # How a push reaches a client
//!
//! 1. A handler builds a [`RealtimeEnvelope`] and calls [`Hub::publish`] with the `audience`
//!    (user ids allowed to receive it, computed from membership at publish time).
//! 2. `publish` serializes a [`FanoutMessage`] and `PUBLISH`es it to the single `rt:fanout` Valkey
//!    channel via the command pool.
//! 3. Every API instance runs one [`SubscriberClient`] subscribed to `rt:fanout`. On each message
//!    its background task calls [`Hub::dispatch_local`], which delivers the inner envelope to every
//!    locally-connected sender whose user is in the audience.
//!
//! Going through Valkey even for the local instance keeps a single code path and makes the design
//! horizontally scalable: add API processes and they all see every event, each delivering only to
//! the clients it holds. The subscriber never touches PostgreSQL. A future optimization (noted, not
//! built) is to shard `rt:fanout` per space to cut cross-instance chatter.
