//! The real-time event envelope pushed to clients, and the fan-out wire type.
//!
//! Every server-to-client push is a [`RealtimeEnvelope`]: a versioned, self-describing frame the
//! client can switch on without guessing. Handlers never build one by hand: they call the small
//! constructors here so the `type` strings stay in one place and can never drift from the payload.
//!
//! Between API instances, an envelope travels wrapped in a [`FanoutMessage`] that also carries the
//! `audience` (the user ids allowed to receive it). The audience is computed once, at publish time,
//! from membership, so the receiving side never touches the database on the hot path. Clients only
//! ever see the inner `envelope`: the audience is stripped before delivery.
