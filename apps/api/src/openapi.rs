//! OpenAPI document generation.
//!
//! The specification is derived from the code (route attributes and typed schemas)
//! with `utoipa`, so the published contract can never drift from the implementation.
//! The raw document is served at `/api/openapi.json`; an interactive viewer is layered
//! on top in the web bundle.
