# AGENTS.md - apps/web

The Next.js web client, compiled to a **static export** and served by the Rust API. See
the root `AGENTS.md` for project-wide rules; this file adds app-specific context.

## Hard constraints

- **Static export only** (`output: "export"`): no SSR, no Server Actions, no Next API
  routes, no server-side image optimization. All server logic lives in the Rust API.
  Anything that needs a server goes through `fetch` to the API.
- **No Node in production.** Next.js is a build tool; the output in `out/` is what ships.
- **Self-hosted fonts.** IBM Plex Sans/Mono are served from `public/fonts/` as committed woff2
  (latin subset, static per weight: Sans 400/500/600/700, Mono 400/500/600; OFL, see the README and
  `OFL.txt` there). The `@font-face` rules are in `app/globals.css`, one per weight. Never load fonts
  from Google Fonts or any external CDN. The browser-tab icon is `app/icon.png` (the Ruchoir mark);
  the wordmark and login use `public/brand/ruchoir-mark.png`.
- **CSP is strict** (`script-src 'self'`): any script or viewer must be same-origin, with no
  external request. The API reference is our own renderer at `public/docs/index.html`: a single
  self-contained page that fetches the live spec from `/api/openapi.json` and renders it (no
  third-party viewer, no CDN).

## Stack

- Next.js (App Router) + React + TypeScript.
- Tailwind CSS v4, **CSS-first**: theme tokens live in `app/globals.css` under `@theme`,
  not in a JS config. Two brand colors: terracotta (accent) and deep teal (dark surfaces only);
  warm cream/sand neutrals. IBM Plex is the type family.
- ESLint flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`): import and spread `eslint-config-next`'s native
  flat-config array directly. Do not wrap it in `FlatCompat` (it re-processes an already-flat
  config and crashes under ESLint 10).

> **Gotcha - the lint toolchain lags the newest majors.** `eslint-config-next` 16 pulls in
> `typescript-eslint` and `eslint-plugin-react`, which do not support the very latest majors yet:
> - **TypeScript stays on 6.x**: `next build` works with TS 7 (the native compiler) but
>   typescript-eslint does not (issue #10940), so `eslint .` crashes.
> - **ESLint stays on 9.x**: `eslint-plugin-react` 7.x uses `context.getFilename()`, removed in
>   ESLint 10, so linting crashes under ESLint 10.
> Track the newest versions the whole plugin chain supports, not the absolute newest tags; bump
> once the plugins catch up.

## Commands

- Dev server: `pnpm --filter @ruchoir/web dev`
- Build (static export to `out/`): `pnpm --filter @ruchoir/web build`
- Lint: `pnpm --filter @ruchoir/web lint`
- Responsive audit: `pnpm --filter @ruchoir/web audit:responsive` (run against a live dev server)

## Dev deep-link

The app is a state machine (auth stage + view + optional modal), not routes. `lib/dev/deeplink.ts`
reads query params (`?stage=`, `view=`, `channel=`, `panel=`, `modal=`, `prefsTab=`, `text=`, `font=`,
`pop=`, `welcome=1`, `push=1`) on mount to land directly on any screen. `prefsTab=` picks the preferences
section when `view=prefs` (appearance/notifications/shortcuts/security/emojis). `welcome=1` shows the
first-run checklist (a deep-link otherwise forces it hidden so it does not clutter audited screens). In the compact shell `push=1`
opens the content full-screen instead of the
bottom-tab list, so the audit can reach the mobile conversation/content views. It is **development only**: `readDeepLink()` returns `null` under `NODE_ENV=production`,
so the static export ignores it. Used by the responsive audit to reach every state without click
scripting.

## Responsive shell

Below ~960px (`useCompact()`), `AppRoot` switches from the desktop three-column shell to a compact
Slack-style layout: a `MobileTopBar` (workspace mark opens the rail drawer; back arrow when a
conversation/view is pushed), a single full-width body that shows either the current list or the
pushed content, and `BottomTabs` (Canaux / Messages / Activité / Recherche). The workspace rail is a
left `Drawer` (DS); the channel right-panel (`RightDock`) becomes a full-width overlay via
`ChannelScreen compact`. `Sidebar` takes `compact` (full width, no wordmark/header/search) and `only`
(render just one section for a bottom-tab). At and above ~960px the desktop columns are unchanged.
Breakpoint chosen from the audit (content breaks up to ~900px). Responsive views take a `compact`
prop: `FilesScreen` (card grid instead of the 7-column table; toolbar/header wrap), `WorkspaceSettings`
(sub-nav wraps above the panel; rows wrap), `ChannelScreen` (header actions in a horizontal scroller,
title/topic truncate). The channel right panel defaults to closed (`panel: null`) and `openChannel` resets it, so you land on
the conversation, not a full-screen dock, and a panel opened in one channel does not carry into the next. Below 600px `.wc-dlg` becomes a full-width bottom sheet whose
body scrolls (first width `@media` in the app, in `components.css`); the top-bar actions are 44px on
mobile. Action fills use `--action-primary-bg: terracotta-600` (not -500) so white text clears WCAG AA;
terracotta-500 stays the brand accent (borders, wordmark dot, links, focus ring). `--text-subtle` is
`#6c6c64` (not grey-500 #7a7a71, which was only 4.33:1) so small subtle labels clear AA on light
surfaces. The responsive audit measures overlap on VISIBLE (clip-intersected) rects, so controls
scrolled under a bar are not false positives. Remaining touch-target
(<44px on dense secondary icons) and tiny-text (11px labels) findings are a deliberate density trade-off,
not bugs.

## Responsive audit (`tools/responsive-audit/`)

Automated responsive stress test: sweeps every UI state across a wide viewport matrix (320 -> 3840,
both orientations, zoom levels, breakpoint neighbours), runs an in-page probe, screenshots the
suspect combinations, and writes `report/report.{json,html}`. Exits non-zero on a critical issue or
JS error (CI-gateable). Beyond mechanical layout it also runs UX/a11y checks (finding
`category: "ux"`): low-contrast (WCAG AA), tiny text (<12px), and dialogs taller than the viewport. See its `README.md`. Depends on **Playwright** as a dev-only dependency:
Microsoft (US) governance, flagged under repo rule #2, kept out of the production runtime/export
(locally-executed QA tooling only, consistent with the R7 reading). Install:
`pnpm --dir apps/web add -D playwright && pnpm --dir apps/web exec playwright install chromium`.

## Design system

Integration started in **L5a** (UI shell exploration on mocked data; spec in
`docs/specs/L5a-ui-shell-exploration.md`). Recreate mockups faithfully in React; do not copy
prototype internals when they do not fit. Enforce token usage with the design-system oxlint config.

- **Tokens** live in `app/tokens.css` (the full DS variable set as `:root` custom properties)
  plus a brand subset mirrored in `app/globals.css` `@theme` for Tailwind utilities. Component
  styles are in `app/components.css`, ported once into static CSS (the handoff injected them at
  runtime; we do not, to stay static-export- and CSP-safe).
- **Primitives** are in `components/ds/` (import from `@/components/ds`).
- **Icons: `lucide-react`** (ISC, community-governed), rendered as inline SVG via the map in
  `components/ds/Icon.tsx`. The handoff's `Icon` loads Lucide from `unpkg.com` at runtime: do NOT
  copy that, it breaks sovereignty and the strict CSP. Likewise the handoff's `tokens/fonts.css`
  pulls IBM Plex from Google Fonts: ignore it, fonts are self-hosted (see above). Extend the icon
  map rather than reaching for a URL.
- **No remote media.** In the exploration, images/media are rendered from local sources (inline
  SVG, or same-origin bytes later), never a remote `<img src>`: sovereignty + CSP. See
  `features/channel/InlineImage.tsx` for the pattern.
- **App code** is organized as `features/<area>/` (screens) reading domain data only through the
  data seam `@/lib/data`, never from `lib/mock` directly (this is what lets L5b swap mocks for the
  real API without touching views).
- **Floating UI** (menus, emoji picker, profile card) uses `components/ds/Popover.tsx`: portaled to
  `body`, `position: fixed`, viewport-aware (flips/clamps so it never overflows). Do not hand-roll
  absolute-positioned popovers. Enter/exit animations go through `features/app/useMountAnimation.ts`
  plus the `wc-pop` / `wc-dock--in|out` classes in `components.css` (all honour reduced motion).
- **Emoji** render through the `features/app/Emoji.tsx` component as same-origin Fluent assets when
  the self-hosted pack is present, falling back to the OS-native glyph otherwise. Never a remote
  emoji CDN. The component consults the pack manifest (`features/app/emojiManifest.ts`, fetched once
  from `/emoji/manifest.json`) so it only ever requests an asset that exists: static glyphs come from
  a single shared sprite via `<use href="/emoji/sprite.svg#e{codepoint}">` (one cached request for
  the whole picker, prefetched on manifest load), and animated APNGs (`/emoji/animated/{codepoint}.png`)
  are requested only for the curated codepoints that have one. Codepoint key from `lib/emojiCode.ts`.
  This avoids the old one-image-per-tile pattern and the doomed animated requests that flooded the
  network and flickered when the picker opened. Animation is **opt-in per call site** via the
  `Emoji` `animated` prop (default off) and reserved for reaction surfaces: the reaction pills and the
  reaction picker + quick-reaction row (`ReactionMenu` passes `animated` to `EmojiPicker`). Each
  reaction pill is a `ReactionPill` (`features/channel/ReactionPill.tsx`) that plays the animation for
  3s the first time it scrolls into view (message seen), then settles to the static sprite; while the
  whole pill is hovered the animation plays continuously and freezes again on mouse leave. Toggling
  `Emoji`'s `animated` flag remounts the APNG node, so a flip restarts it from frame 0. The picker
  animates while it is open. Message bodies and the composer's emoji picker stay on the static sprite.
  It is still gated by the `emojiAnimated` user setting. `:shortcodes:` resolve via `node-emoji`, in-text emoji are detected with `emoji-regex`.
  The pack is built by `scripts/build-emoji-pack.sh` (one-shot: sparse-clones the Fluent repos without
  the ~5GB, then runs `scripts/prepare-emoji.mjs`, which emits `sprite.svg` + curated `animated/*.png`
  + `manifest.json`) into `public/emoji/` (dev, gitignored) or a dir behind the API's
  `RUCHOIR_EMOJI_DIR` (prod). Fallback chain per emoji: animated (reactions, opt-in) -> static
  (sprite) -> native. Emoji picker data/keywords live in `lib/emoji.ts`.
- **User settings** live in `features/app/settings.tsx` (`SettingsProvider` + `useSettings`,
  persisted to localStorage): theme, typeface, text size, notification prefs, account security,
  emoji animation, the simulated pack-present flag, and keyboard-shortcut bindings.
- **Keyboard shortcuts.** Commands and their default chords live in `features/app/shortcuts.ts`
  (`COMMANDS`, `DEFAULT_BINDINGS`, plus `eventToChord`/`formatChord`; `Mod` = Cmd on macOS, Ctrl
  elsewhere). Bindings persist in the settings and are user-editable in Préférences > Raccourcis
  (`ShortcutsSection` in `PreferencesScreen.tsx`, capture-to-rebind). `features/app/useGlobalShortcuts.ts`
  matches keydowns against the live bindings and runs the handler wired in `AppRoot`; it is suspended
  while any modal/dialog/preferences overlay is open. The `HelpDialog` shortcut list reads the same
  live bindings. The quick switcher (`QuickSwitcher.tsx`, default `Mod+J`) jumps to a channel/DM;
  global search (`GlobalSearchDialog.tsx`, default `Mod+K`) spans messages/files/people. Both support
  arrow + Enter selection.
- **Avatars** are generated locally with DiceBear (`lib/avatar.ts`, `@dicebear/core` v10 +
  `@dicebear/styles` JSON defs), seeded by name, cached, emitted as data URIs (no remote request).
  Styles by subject: person=cameo, bot=gaze, workspace=blobs. Person/bot backgrounds are lively
  pastels chosen for face contrast and **never terracotta/red** (single brand accent rule).
- **Message text** is rendered by `features/channel/richText.tsx` (bold, italic, inline + fenced
  code, links, "- " lists, @mentions), building React nodes. The only `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is
  highlight.js output for fenced code blocks (`highlight.js`, BSD-3, local, language auto-detect) and
  is safe because highlight.js escapes the code. The composer emits this same lightweight markdown.
  Render message bodies in a `<div>`, never a `<p>` (fenced code / lists produce `<pre>`/`<ul>`,
  which are illegal inside `<p>` and cause a hydration error). A message that is **emoji-only** (only
  emoji + whitespace, no fenced code) renders them larger, tapering with the count (1 -> 44px, 2-3 ->
  36px, 4+ -> 28px; `jumboEmojiCount`/`emojiSizeFor`). Every message emoji shows its `:shortcode:` on
  hover in a styled DS `Tooltip` (not the native `title`), the label from `shortcodeOf` (node-emoji
  `which`).
- **Message input** is a shared rich editor, `features/channel/MessageEditor.tsx`, used by both the
  channel `Composer` and the `ThreadPanel` reply box (the `ProfilePanel` bio stays a plain `Textarea`,
  it is not a message field). It is an **uncontrolled contenteditable** (`.wc-rich-input`), not a
  textarea, so it can render inline Fluent emote **chips**: picking or typing an emoji inserts a
  `contentEditable=false` span carrying `data-emoji` (built by `features/channel/composerEditor.ts`,
  static sprite). `onSend` receives the **serialised plain text** (emotes back to their Unicode glyph,
  `<br>`/blocks to `\n`), so the message pipeline and `richText` rendering are unchanged. The
  surrounding toolbar (bold/italic/code/list, emoji picker, send) drives the editor through a ref
  handle (`MessageEditorHandle`: `submit`/`insertEmoji`/`insertText`/`wrapSelection`/`prefixLines`/
  `codeFormat`/`isEmpty`/`clear`). `isEmpty`/`clear` let the `Composer` send an attachment-only
  message (empty body) and reset after. Paste is coerced to plain text; caret/offsets are mapped by
  serialising the range from the editor start to the selection focus (`editorState`).
- **Screens & shell state.** `features/app/AppRoot.tsx` is the client spine: it lifts the seed
  collections (workspaces, channels, DMs, files, and a full per-conversation message map) into
  `useState` so the UI can mutate them, gates the app behind an `authStage` state machine
  (`login -> signup -> onboarding -> app`; boots at `app`, logout returns to `login`), and routes
  every global dialog through a single `modal` union. The auth/onboarding screens live in
  `features/auth/` (`AuthShell` centered layout, `LoginScreen`, `SignupScreen`, and the multi-step
  `OnboardingFlow` that creates the first workspace). Screens live in
  `features/{auth,files,import,settings}/` and `features/channel/`; the Threads/Mentions/Saved views
  are `features/app/ActivityView.tsx` fed by the cross-conversation collectors in
  `features/app/activity.ts`. Small global dialogs (new channel/message/workspace, invite, help) are
  grouped in `features/app/dialogs.tsx`; channel-menu dialogs in `features/channel/ChannelDialogs.tsx`;
  workspace-wide search in `features/app/GlobalSearchDialog.tsx`. A conversation is a direct message
  when its id matches a DM (ChannelScreen takes an optional `dm` prop and adapts its header/intro).
- **DS primitives now include** `Checkbox`, `Radio`, `Switch`, `Select`, `Field` and `Dialog`, ported
  from the handoff into typed React with their CSS appended to `app/components.css` (the handoff
  injected it at runtime; we do not). `Dialog` is the shared modal base (scrim + head + body + footer,
  closes on scrim/Escape); reuse it rather than hand-rolling a scrim.
- **First-run onboarding.** The signup wizard is `features/auth/OnboardingFlow.tsx` (workspace name,
  profile, invites). Inside the app, `features/app/GettingStarted.tsx` is a floating, collapsible
  checklist (create a channel, send a message, invite, import, profile) whose state persists in
  `settings.welcome` (`{ dismissed, done }`). Clicking a step runs the real action and ticks it off;
  the Help dialog's first link reopens it (`restartWelcome` in `AppRoot`).
- **Empty / no-results states** all go through `components/ds/EmptyState.tsx` (icon, title,
  description, optional action). `size="hero"` fills a whole view (icon in a soft badge); `size="compact"`
  suits popovers, side panels and search dropdowns. Do not hand-roll empty placeholders; reuse this so
  they stay consistent.
- **Composer autocomplete** (inside `MessageEditor`): one keyboard-navigable suggestion popup serves
  both triggers, `@mention` (members) and `:shortcode:` (emoji, via `searchShortcodes` in
  `lib/shortcodes.ts`, backed by node-emoji `search`, prefix matches ranked first). A single `trigger`
  state (`kind`/`query`/`start`) plus an `active` index drives it; the editor is an ARIA `combobox`
  (`aria-activedescendant` on the options, ids namespaced per instance via `useId`). Keys: Up/Down
  move, Enter/Tab accept, Esc dismisses; hover syncs `active`, and option `onMouseDown` is prevented so
  the editor keeps focus. Picking a mention inserts `@name `, a shortcode inserts an emote chip. The
  shortcode trigger fires from the first character after the colon and only at a token start
  (`(?:^|\s):`), so times like `10:30` do not trigger it. The `Popover` (`components/ds/Popover.tsx`)
  measures before paint on every open render (and via a `ResizeObserver` for async resizes), so a
  shrinking/growing list stays anchored to the input with no stale-gap or flash.
